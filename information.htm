			<h1 id="physical">Physical Description</h1>
				<p>Dolphins range in size from the 1.7 m (5.6 ft) long and 50 kg (110 lb) Maui's dolphin to the 9.5 m (31 ft) and 10 t (11 short tons) killer whale. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the males are larger than females. They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers. Though not quite as flexible as seals, some dolphins can travel at 55.5 km/h (34.5 mph). Dolphins use their conical shaped teeth to capture fast moving prey. They have well-developed hearing which is adapted for both air and water and is so well developed that some can survive even if they are blind. Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. They have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin to keep warm in the cold water.</p>
				
			<h1 id="personality">Personality & Behavior</h1>
				<p>Dolphins are well known for their agility and playful behavior, making them a favorite of wildlife watchers. Many species will leap out of the water and follow ships, often synchronizing their movements with one another. Scientists believe that dolphins conserve energy by swimming alongside ships, a practice known as bow-riding.</p>
				<p>Dolphins live in social groups of five to several hundred. They use echolocation to find prey and often hunt together by surrounding a school of fish, trapping them and taking turns swimming through the school and catching fish. Dolphins will also follow seabirds, other whales and fishing boats to feed opportunistically on the fish they scare up or discard.</p>
				
			<h1 id="habitat">Habitat</h1>
				<p>Most of them live in saltwater but they can also live in freshwater locations. Only a handful of the species though are known to thrive in freshwater regions. They tend to stick to the shallow areas of the water found along the continental shelves. The types of dolphins you will find depend on the species though in terms of the location.</p>
				<p>Dolphins tend to like areas that have warmer temperatures too. However, sometimes they are found in colder water due to the need for food. It is very interesting to see some places where they live. Studies show that the habitat of the dolphin is quite diversified due to environmental factors and food accessibility. They are very smart creatures and have the intelligence to modify their habitat when possible for survival.</p>
				
			<h1 id="diet">Diet</h1>
				<p>Dolphins are carnivores; they eat other animals. Dolphins eat a variety of fish, squid, shrimps, jellyfish and octopuses. The types of fish and other creatures dolphins eat depends on the species of dolphin, where the dolphins live and the wildlife that shares their habitats. A few, like the killer whale, feed on large mammals, like seals. </p>
				
				<p>Dolphins get all the water they need directly from the food they eat. Their main prey (fish and squid) contains large amounts of water. Dolphins donâ€™t lose water by sweating, like we do, and so they need less water than us in their diets.</p>
